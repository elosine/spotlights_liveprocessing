Change spt speed
glow on spots rim
Introduce barriers



make class of spinners
with osc


//AMPLITUDE BASED ON SIZE
//MAKE TEXTURE AND SOUNDS FROM PIXEL CT
//USING RESTITUTION RELEASE BALLS same size AND HAVE DIFFERENT BOUNCES ON BOTTOM ONLY

FIX ELECTRONICS AND CONTROL BUS ARCHITECTURE


MAKE MIXER FOR DIFFERENT SOUNDS BASED ON COLOR OF THE PIXELS


MAKE A OBSTICLE IN CENTER THAT WILL SEND SA2
X STEREO FIELD

Amplitude Scaling based on size of Spotlight

 
Y TASTEFUL VARIATIONS ON SYNTH - MAYBE IT ADJUSTS THE RANGE/SPEED OF VARIATION
MODULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT ANIMATED MASKS

RESTITUTIONS
BRICKS
DIFFERENT SIZE BALLS

UNISONS, THEN INTRODUCE BRICKS, MAKE THEM DIFFERENT HEIGHTS, INTRO RESTITUTION>1 ACCEL, THEN REST<1 DECEL
ANIMATED BRICKS, BRICKS WILL BE SA2

UNDERLAYER TEXTURES FOR OTHER SYNTHESIS


OBSTICLES FROM TOUCH OSC

Lift and Bounce

//USE RESTITUTIONS
//OBSTICALES TO GENERATE DIFFERENT SHORT ATTACKS; WALLS SA0
//THIRD SHORT ATTACK - karplus strong
//USER CONTROLLED SHOOTERS THAT MOVE THE BALLS
//USE TEXTURES

//HAVE AN OBJECT THAT THE SPS HIT AND CHANGES SHORT ATTACK 1'S FREQUENCY
//AMPLITUDE AND CHANGING SIZE
//WAY TO MAKE NO SOUND
//ADD BARRIERS WITH X/Y POS AND ROTATION, SIZE, MAKE/REMOVE, INITIAL SIZE; USE TOUCH OSC; 
 

//STEREO BASED ON X POS


//STOP SPOTLIGHT
//MAP SPOTLIGHT Y AXIS TO SHORT ATTACK RESONANCE OR FILTER FREQUENCY RANGE
//ATTACH DIFFERENT SHORT ATTACKS TO DIFFERENT SPOTLIGHTS
//MAKE WAGON WHEEL SPIN FOR SHORT ATTACK 2
//STARBURST FOR SHORT ATTACK 3
//MAKE SYNTHESIS ENGINES FOR IMPACTS AND DIFFERENT COLORS
//DIFFERENT SET OF SYNTHESIS FOR EACH SPOTLIGHT - START WITH ONE


//DEBUG PIXEL COUNT; TRY RUNNING FUNCTION DIRECTLY OUTSIDE OF CLASS
//DETECT NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COLOR PIXELS WITHIN SPOTLIGHT, LOOK AT COMPUTER VISION STUFF

//Introduce Barriers
// Draw on masked layer
//Tractor Beam
//Oscillating size of spotlight for dynamics
//make an 'lfo' use min size max size and speed and modulo to number of frames
//have a ramp of above for crescendi
//how to make chordal structures?
//staff line with height as note and fill to play
//preselected scalar/chordal sets

//for bouncing attacks, can have letter that indicates concert pitch in any octive
//or with subscript for particular octive

//crescendi with zips moving along x-axis and size of spot as max volume
// as zips move through spot crescendo then decrescendo
// have quick transitions between spot sizes to indicate max volume
// can have vertical position be pitch
// can have this simultanious with impact/attacks with attacks interrupting crescendi
//if using pitch, attacks will have to come from objects hitting the spots
//can have orange shape moving about masking over zips being improv that interrupts the crescendi


//FIXES

Fix  Color lookup.  Right now if color name isn't there it throws an error
